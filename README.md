The idea here is to make a 3D model of the old camp in Rowley, MA, with colors,
that can be printed with [Shapeways's color sandstone](https://www.shapeways.com/materials/full-color-sandstone) process.
There ought to be lots of photos of the place since my family spent plenty of summers there
when I was a kid, but this is the one I can easily put my hands on, which my mom had
made into a placemat.

My grandfather purchased the camp in the 1950s, and it was destroyed by an ice storm in the mid 90s.
It was built in at least two stages, the front porch being an addition to a pre-existing
building since there was outside shingles on the interior wall at the back of the porch.

I was working at Polaroid when the building was destroyed, and it had never crossed my mind that
it wouldn't be around forever since it had been there as long as I could remember. So now I
deeply regret not taking plenty of photos of it. What I really wish I could do is a detailed
rendering in something like Second Life, with all the interior stuff my siblings and cousins
will remember from our childhoods. Maybe we can collect our recollections and do something
like that. But I remember things like a nautical chart that hung over the dining table, and
a Franklin stove with an exhaust pipe that meandered around the living room ceiling to reach
the chimney, and a razor clam preserved in a jar of formaldehyde sitting on a shelf. Lots of
other stuff.

I'm going to try to model the building in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/), at least the
exterior, and maybe later I can get more detailed and model the interior. But I'd love to be
able to make those color sandstone models as gifts for the surviving members of my mom's
generation, who also remember the place fondly.
